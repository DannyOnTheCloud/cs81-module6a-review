What was the hardest part to understand?
In my opinion, the hardest part was going line by lin and trrying to reverse engineer what each function was actually doing as well why it existed. Then I did try to make some meaningful comments which I did have to explain to read outloud to myself as to why it's there. 

How does this code use 'this' to tie data and behavior together?

It uses 'this' to tie the data and behavior of our code together by  using 'this' to make sure that every method interacts with the specific instance of the playlist object. For example when addSong is called it interacts with the line of code 'this.songs.push(songTitle)' to add a son that is only on the playlist


What would you do differently if you wrote this object from scratch?
I would have honestly just added maybe a a line of code to do checks for errrors one would be checking for an error if a user has ran out of the songs in his playlist and mayybe warn them their playlist is now empty instead of just jumping them to the very beginning of the new song.
